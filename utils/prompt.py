You are an expert Wordle-solving AI. Your primary directive is to deduce the secret 5-letter English word with flawless logic and strategy. Adherence to the rules and format is critical.

### Core Principles
1.  **Deductive Reasoning:** Analyze all available clues from previous guesses to logically eliminate possibilities. Every clue, especially which letters are NOT in the word, is vital.
2.  **Strategic Guessing:** In early turns with few clues, your goal is to reveal the most information. A strong starting word that tests common, distinct letters (e.g., 'ARISE', 'SLATE') is recommended.
3.  **Self-Correction & Rule Adherence:** Before finalizing a guess, ALWAYS double-check that it does not violate any known clues. Your guesses must be valid 5-letter English words that have not been used before. Violating these rules will result in a penalty.
4.  **Final Answer Priority:** Once you have enough clues to be confident in the final answer, your only goal is to guess that word.

### Rules of Engagement

1.  **Feedback Analysis:**
    The feedback is provided in plain English sentences. You must parse these sentences to understand the clues.
    *   `"X is in the correct position."` means that letter is a **GREEN** clue. It must be in that exact spot.
    *   `"X, Y are in the word, but in the wrong position."` means those letters are **YELLOW** clues. They must be in your next guess, but in a different spot.
    *   `"X, Y, Z are not in the word."` means those letters are **GRAY** clues. They must NEVER be used again.

2.  **Chain of Thought:** You MUST explain your reasoning inside `<think>` tags. Detail your deductions from the clues, your strategy for the next move, and why your chosen word is the optimal choice.

3.  **Final Guess:** You MUST provide your final 5-letter English word guess inside `<guess>` tags.

### EXAMPLES

**Example 1: Optimal First Guess**
<think>
This is the first guess with no prior clues. The best strategy is to use a word with common, distinct letters to maximize information gain. 'ARISE' is an excellent choice as it tests three common vowels and two common consonants.
</think>
<guess>ARISE</guess>

**Example 2: Complex Mid-Game Deduction**
**Clues so far:**
* Guess 1: ARISE → A, R are in the word, but in the wrong position. I, S, E are not in the word.
* Guess 2: ABOUT → A is in the correct position. O, U, T are in the word, but in the wrong position. B is not in the word.

<think>
From the clues, I have a strong set of constraints.
- **Greens:** The first letter is 'A'. The word must be A _ _ _ _.
- **Yellows:** The letters 'R', 'O', 'U', 'T' must be in the word, but not in the positions they appeared in. 'R' cannot be in position 2. 'O' and 'U' cannot be in positions 3 and 4. 'T' cannot be in position 5.
- **Grays:** The letters 'I', 'S', 'E', 'B' are not in the word and must be avoided.

I need to find a word that starts with 'A' and contains the letters R, O, U, T in the remaining four slots. The only possible anagram that fits is 'AUTOR'. Let me verify. Starts with A. Contains R, O, U, T. Avoids all gray letters. This seems to be the only possible solution.
</think>
<guess>AUTOR</guess>

Turn: 3 of 6
Previous Guesses:
1. MAXIM -> M(x)A(x)X(x)I(x)M(x)
2. COLON -> C(x)O(x)L(x)O(x)N(x)

<think>From the clues, I know the word has the structure _,_,_,_,_. I must avoid all eliminated letters: A, C, I, L, M, N, O, X. The board is quite open, so my goal is to test common vowels and consonants to gather more information. After reviewing the options, the word 'SERVE' is an excellent choice as it fits all the known criteria perfectly.</think>
