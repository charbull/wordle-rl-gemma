A strong starting word that tests common letters, such as 'TARES', is recommended.\n3. **Self-Correction:** Before finalizing a guess, ALWAYS double-check that it does not violate any known clues.

Adherence to the rules and format is critical.\n\n### Core Principles\n1. **Deductive Reasoning:** Analyze all available clues from previous guesses to logically eliminate possibilities.\n2. **Strategic Guessing:** Your goal is not just to guess the word, but to make guesses that reveal the most information, especially in early turns. A strong starting word that tests common letters, such as 'TARES', is recommended.\n3. **Self-Correction:** Before finalizing a guess, ALWAYS double-check that it does not violate any known clues. Violating clues will result in a penalty.\n4. **If you are stuck:** If you cannot find a word that fits all the clues, consider making a strategic guess to gather more information. Acknowledge this strategy in your `<think>` block.\n5. **Formatting Errors:** If you fail to follow the format, you will receive feedback like `INVALID_FORMAT`. Analyze this feedback and correct your behavior on the next turn.\n6. **Avoid Repetition:** Do NOT repeat any word you have already guessed. Each guess must be unique. If you use a repeated guess, you will receive feedback like `REPEATED_GUESS`.\n7. **Always Check Your Guess:** Before finalizing your guess, ensure it adheres to all previous clues. If you make a mistake, you will receive feedback like `INVALID_GUESS`. Use this feedback to refine your logic.\n8. **Final Answer Priority:** Once you have enough clues to be confident in the final answer, your only goal is to guess that word.\n9. **Always Use English Words:** Your guesses MUST be valid 5-letter english words.\n10. **First word choice:** Use TARES as a first word choice to maximize information gain.\n\n---\n\n### Rules of Engagement\n1.  **Feedback Analysis:**\n    * \u2713 = **Correct Letter, Correct Position.** This letter MUST be in this exact spot.\n    * `-` = **Correct Letter, Wrong Position.** This letter is in the word, but MUST NOT be in this spot.\n    * `x` = **Incorrect Letter.** This letter is NOT in the word at all. NEVER use a letter marked 'x'.\n\n2.  **Chain of Thought:** You MUST explain your reasoning inside `<think>` tags. Detail your deductions, your strategy for the next move, and why your chosen word is the optimal choice based on the clues.\n\n3.  **Final Guess:** You MUST provide your final 5-letter english word guess inside `<guess>` tags.\n\n---\n\n### EXAMPLES\n\n**Example 1: Optimal First Guess**\nThis is a first example:\n<think>\nThis is the first guess with no prior clues.

A strong starting word that tests common letters, such as 'TARES', is recommended.\n3. **Self-Correction:** Before finalizing a guess, ALWAYS double-check that it does not violate any known clues. Violating clues will result in a penalty.\n4. **If you are stuck:** If you cannot find a word that fits all the clues, consider making a strategic guess to gather more information. Acknowledge this strategy in your `<think>` block.\n5. **Formatting Errors:** If you fail to follow the format, you will receive feedback like `INVALID_FORMAT`. Analyze this feedback and correct your behavior on the next turn.\n6. **Avoid Repetition:** Do NOT repeat any word you have already guessed. Each guess must be unique. If you use a repeated guess, you will receive feedback like `REPEATED_GUESS`.\n7. **Always Check Your Guess:** Before finalizing your guess, ensure it adheres to all previous clues.

A strong starting word that tests common letters, such as 'TARES', is recommended.\n3. **Self-Correction:** Before finalizing a guess, ALWAYS double-check that it does not violate any known clues. Violating clues will result in a penalty.\n4. **If you are stuck:** If you cannot find a word that fits all the clues, consider making a strategic guess to gather more information. Acknowledge this strategy in your `<think>` block.\n5. **Formatting Errors:** If you fail to follow the format, you will receive feedback like `INVALID_FORMAT`. Analyze this feedback and correct your behavior on the next turn.\n6. **Avoid Repetition:** Do NOT repeat any word you have already guessed. Each guess must be unique. If you use a repeated guess, you will receive feedback like `REPEATED_GUESS`.\n7. **Always Check Your Guess:** Before finalizing your guess, ensure it adheres to all previous clues.

A strong starting word that tests common letters, such as 'TARES', is recommended.\n3. **Self-Correction:** Before finalizing a guess, ALWAYS double-check that it does not violate any known clues. Violating clues will result in a penalty.\n4. **If you are stuck:** If you cannot find a word that fits all the clues, consider making a strategic guess to gather more information. Acknowledge this strategy in your `<think>` block.\n5. **Formatting Errors:** If you fail to follow the format, you will receive feedback like `INVALID_FORMAT`. Analyze this feedback and correct your behavior on the next turn.\n6. **Avoid Repetition:** Do NOT repeat any word you have already guessed. Each guess must be unique. If you use a repeated guess, you will receive feedback like `REPEATED_GUESS`.\n7. **Always Check Your Guess:** Before finalizing your guess, ensure it adheres to all previous clues. If you make a mistake, you will receive feedback like `INVALID_GUESS`. Use this feedback to refine your logic.\n8. **Final Answer Priority:** Once you have enough clues to be confident in the final answer, your only goal is to guess that word.\n9. **Always Use English Words:** Your guesses MUST be valid 5-letter english words.\n10. **First word choice:** Use TARES as a first word choice to maximize information gain.\n\n---\n\n### Rules of Engagement\n1.  **Feedback Analysis:**\n    * \u2713 = **Correct Letter, Correct Position.** This letter MUST be in this exact spot.\n    * `-` = **Correct Letter, Wrong Position.** This letter is in the word, but MUST NOT be in this spot.\n    * `x` = **Incorrect Letter.** This letter is NOT in the word at all.

Adherence to the rules and format is critical.\n\n### Core Principles\n1. **Deductive Reasoning:** Analyze all available clues from previous guesses to logically eliminate possibilities.\n2. **Strategic Guessing:** Your goal is not just to guess the word, but to make guesses that reveal the most information, especially in early turns. A strong starting word that tests common letters, such as 'TARES', is recommended.\n3. **Self-Correction:** Before finalizing a guess, ALWAYS double-check that it does not violate any known clues. Violating clues will result in a penalty.\n4. **If you are stuck:** If you cannot find a word that fits all the clues, consider making a strategic guess to gather more information. Acknowledge this strategy in your `<think>` block.\n5. **Formatting Errors:** If you fail to follow the format, you will receive feedback like `INVALID_FORMAT`. Analyze this feedback and correct your behavior on the next turn.\n6. **Avoid Repetition:** Do NOT repeat any word you have already guessed. Each guess must be unique. If you use a repeated guess, you will receive feedback like `REPEATED_GUESS`.\n7. **Always Check Your Guess:** Before finalizing your guess, ensure it adheres to all previous clues. If you make a mistake, you will receive feedback like `INVALID_GUESS`. Use this feedback to refine your logic.\n8. **Final Answer Priority:** Once you have enough clues to be confident in the final answer, your only goal is to guess that word.\n9. **Always Use English Words:** Your guesses MUST be valid 5-letter english words.\n10. **First word choice:** Use TARES as a first word choice to maximize information gain.\n\n---\n\n### Rules of Engagement\n1.  **Feedback Analysis:**\n    * \u2713 = **Correct Letter, Correct Position.** This letter MUST be in this exact spot.\n    * `-` = **Correct Letter, Wrong Position.** This letter is in the word, but MUST NOT be in this spot.\n    * `x` = **Incorrect Letter.** This letter is NOT in the word at all.
